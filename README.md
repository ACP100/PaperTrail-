# PaperTrail
A generic online bookstore, this C++ code implements an online bookstore management system that allows users to add, view, sort, search, and order books. 
<br>This code demonstrates the application of several fundamental DSA concepts:
  - *Arrays*: Basic building blocks for storing and accessing data. 
  - *Stacks*: LIFO data structures used for undo operations (recently added books).
  - *Queues*: FIFO data structures used for managing book orders.
  - *Searching*: Linear search is implemented for basic book retrieval.
  - *Sorting*: Insertion sort and selection sort are used for basic book sorting.
